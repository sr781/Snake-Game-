# Snake-Game
A Snake Game created in Python with a slight twist! Added turtles. A golden turtle gives 5 points whereas a black turtle takes away 5 points. The pictures below show the game being played. The colour changes every 5 points.

The highscore is contained within a text file. This is so the data is not lost when the game ends.
